# 🐬 Flipper Zero Collection

A personal collection of resources, payloads, and modules for the **Flipper Zero** multi-tool device.  
This repository is designed to extend Flipper's capabilities with organized, ready-to-use files.


## 🛡️ Cyber Assessment Suite (CAS)

A collection of PowerShell + BadUSB scripts for assessing Windows security configurations.  
Originally designed to run through Flipper Zero (or Rubber Ducky), the suite helps check policies, logging, users, firewall status and more.
